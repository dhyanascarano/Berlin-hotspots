# Berlin-hotspots
*When your friends visit Berlin and ask you where the cool areas are*

I'm an Australian living in Berlin. Every year dozens of friends and random people I met while travelling come to Berlin and ask me:
- Which area they should stay in
- Where the cool bars are
- Where the best restaurants are

Berlin is structured in a spread out way, with many "cool" areas. Not one centre of coolness that gets less cool as you go out.

So next time your friends ask you the same question, feel free to use this map. Edit it. Add your own cool areas. And re-share :)
