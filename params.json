{"name":"Berlin-hotspots","tagline":"When your friends visit Berlin and ask you where the cool areas are","body":"# Berlin hotspots\r\nI'm an Australian living in Berlin. Every year dozens of friends, and random people that I met while travelling, come to Berlin and ask me:\r\n\r\n- Which area they should stay in\r\n- Where the cool bars are\r\n- Where the best restaurants are\r\n\r\nBerlin is structured in a spread out way, with many \"cool\" areas. Not one centre of coolness that gets less cool as you go out.\r\n\r\nSo next time your friends ask you the same question, feel free to use this map. Edit it. Add your own cool areas. And re-share :)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
